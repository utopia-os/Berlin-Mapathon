The Berlin Mapathon is a 7-day Mapping Challenge focusing on community, commons, post-growth, regeneration, and the circular economy. The vision for the Mapathon was conceived during the Code 2 Community Hackathon by several participating projects as a follow-up event, featuring a blend of theoretical, practical, and technical sessions.

Besides the theoretical components—encompassing presentations, workshops, and discussions—we will explore the city in small groups. This adds a practical dimension to mapping, facilitating new friendships and network expansion. In the technical sessions, our focus will shift to the development and enhancement of our tools and data structures, with a special emphasis on open data and data interoperability 🔗.

### Open Data and Data Interoperability 🔄

Numerous projects, networks, and applications strive to unite people for change, collective action, and the creation of new regenerative structures 🌱.

We recognize the significant challenge of our time: integrating all these puzzle pieces 🧩.

Our aim is to establish design patterns for an open ecosystem that includes users, projects, apps, and databases. This ecosystem should integrate as smoothly as possible with all current and future projects and networks, fostering a unified field of action 🌐.

By leveraging open data standards and open-source technology (such as [Murmurations](https://murmurations.network/) or [ADAM Protocol](https://ad4m.dev/)), we intend to enable as many projects and networks as possible to interconnect, sharing their data and users. This strategy is designed to maximize interoperability and collaboration across a wide spectrum of change-making initiatives 🔗✨.
