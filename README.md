# Berlin Mapathon

Berlin Mapathon is a 7-day Mapping Challenge 🌟 focusing on community, commons, post-growth, regeneration, and circular economy.

It's gonna be a mix of theoretical , practical , and technical  sessions.

In the theoretical part, we're gonna focus on different fields and aspects of mapping, tooling, and best practices of geographic and thematic mapping 🌍.

In practical sessions, where we explore the city 🚶‍♂️, get in contact 🤝, collect data 📊, and grow the network 🌐.

In the technical sessions, we focus on the development and enhancement of our tools and data structures, with a special focus on open data and data interoperability 🔗.

### Onboarding Quests 🚀

During the week, we are going out in small groups to onboard projects and people into our growing ecosystem. That could also be an opportunity to test out tokenomics and gamification as motivating elements to reward contribution and make everything more fun 🎉.

### Data Interoperability 🔄

There are many projects, networks, and applications aiming to bring people together for change, collective action, and the manifestation of new regenerative structures 🌱. 

We see the great challenge of our time in integrating all these pieces of the puzzle.🧩

Our goal is to create design patterns for an open ecosystem of users, projects, apps, and databases. This ecosystem should integrate as seamlessly as possible with all existing and future projects and networks, fostering a unified field of action. 🌐

By utilizing open data standards and open-source technology (like [Murmurations](https://murmurations.network/) or [ADAM Protocol](https://ad4m.dev/)), we aim to enable as many projects and networks as possible to connect with each other and share their data and users. This approach is intended to maximize interoperability and collaboration across the spectrum of change-making initiatives. 🔗✨
